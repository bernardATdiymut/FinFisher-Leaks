The "weblog-ips-by-assignment-country.log" contains the top 30 (in most cases) IP addresses which accessed the support.finfisher.com website. 

These IP addresses came from the webalizer log files which were present in the weblogs directory, "finfisher/www/conf". I am not drawing any conclusion from these IP addresses as I cannot 100% prove this were intentional accesses.

From an initial viewing, some of these IPs may have accessed the website by mistake, looking for similar domain names. 

However, I have no concrete proof of that.

The majority of the IPs are assigned to various segements of the China Telecom network. 

However there are some interesting accesses from:
